//Classical oop
//a methadology of fuctioning on classes and objects
//classes are blueprints of an object
//by using one class we can create different objects
//if for a person we need to define a class it would be like
// user{
//  name
//  date of birth
//  nationality
//  gender 
// }-this is an example of a class
//now for an object
// user{
//  name='perry'
//  date of birth='20 feb 1993'
//  nationality='german'
//  gender ='male'
// }-this shows an object

//a class has 4 properties
//Abstracting-allows at to get an overview of an object not go on to teeny tiny details
//hides details that doon't matter
//encapsulation-some properties are created as a single unit and are private
//the methods that are not encapsulated are public
//inheritance-when we have two classes closely related then we can
//have one class inherit from the other,so we will have one parent and child class
//child class extents the parent class-so we can reuse the logic common to both cases
//polymorphism-a child class can overwrite a method inherited from the parent class
